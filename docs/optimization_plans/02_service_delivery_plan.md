# Service Delivery Modernization for White Bear Ankele

## Current State Assessment

White Bear Ankele currently operates with a traditional legal service delivery model that relies heavily on attorney expertise and manual document preparation. While effective, this approach limits scalability and creates bottlenecks during high-demand periods.
