## Core System Components

### 1. Automated Legislative Data Collection

| Data Source | Update Frequency | Data Types |
|-------------|------------------|------------|
| Colorado General Assembly Website | Daily | Bill text, amendments, status |
| Committee Hearings | As published | Transcripts, schedules, testimony |
| Fiscal Impact Statements | As published | Financial analysis, projections |
| Historical Bill Database | One-time + updates | Training data, precedent analysis |

**Technical Implementation:**
- Custom web scrapers with resilient error handling
- Structured data transformation pipeline
- Change detection algorithms
- Database with versioning for bill evolution tracking

### 2. AI Classification & Analysis Engine

| Feature | Function | Technology |
|---------|----------|------------|
| Relevance Classification | Determine bill impact on special districts | Fine-tuned LLM, custom taxonomy |
| Entity Recognition | Identify affected district types | Named entity recognition model |
| Topic Modeling | Categorize by subject matter | Clustering algorithms |
| Impact Prediction | Assess potential client impact | Custom predictive models |

**Model Training Approach:**
